# AHSC
GitHub Repository for the MTL 2023 course Project

This project is called AHSC: Automatic Horror Sound Classification and it's about to create a software that classifies different horror sounds. Basically, we get horror sounds from Freesound (https://freesound.org/) and we create a software application that classifies these sounds into different categories.

AHSC is an innovative project developed as part of the Music Technology Workshop elective course for ICT engineering degrees at Pompeu Fabra University. The aim of this project is to develop a software application based on the 'Freesound' website to classify horror sounds by using a new tagging system created by us to classify these horror sounds automatically in subcategories. With almost 12000 available horror-related sounds on the website without specific tags, this project proposes a solution that involves using metadata and implementing classification algorithms to generate subcategories, which will allow for more accurate and specific searches.

To achieve this, the project employs the Python programming language and the Pycharm IDE, along with the powerful 'Essentia' libraries that help with sound analysis and descriptor extraction, and the 'Scikit-learn' library for machine learning techniques.

# Installation
1. Download or clone the repository locally
2. Open the project with PyCharm
3. Open the terminal on the folder freesound-python-master and run the command: python setup.py install
4. Run the project

Also if you don't have installed the libraries we have used, PyCharm we will ask you to install the packages.

# Requirements
* Python version 3.11.2
* PyCharm version 2023.1

# Organization
The code is in the folder AHSC/src and it is divided into different folders, depending on the task (interface, classification, ...).
