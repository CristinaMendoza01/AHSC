This project is called AHSC: Automatic Horror Sound Classification and it's about to create a software that classifies different horror sounds. Basically, we get horror sounds from Freesound and we create a software application that classifies these sounds into different categories.

# To be able to use Freesound
Open the terminal inside the PyCharm Project

Go to freesound-python-master

Run python setup.py install
